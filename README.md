Data analysis using Jupyter Notebook

# Task Given
Perform Data Analysis : Download the attached Jupyter notebook provided with this post. The notebook is designed to facilitate automatic exploratory data analysis when you input your dataset names and modify the column names. The notebook will also train two machine learning algorithms, SVM and Decision Tree, on your dataset (If your label column is categorical Otherwise you will need to write code for Linear Regression and Support Vector Regression on your own) and display the models' performance metrics.

For illustration, I've used the Titanic dataset in the notebook to demonstrate how it works.Run the Jupyter Notebook separately for each of your chosen datasets. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook, and you will be guided through the process. Since each dataset is unique, you may need to modify the code, and errors may arise. You'll need to debug them independently. If you believe that adding some of your own code would bring out insightful information from your dataset, feel free to incorporate it.
